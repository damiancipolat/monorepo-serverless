# Monorepo for serverless

This repository was created to be used in nodejs projects using serverless in aws. The idea is to unify in a single repository the entire code of different services.

This work is based on this post: https://seed.run/blog/how-to-structure-a-real-world-monorepo-serverless-app.html
